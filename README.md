# Employee Monitoring System

1. Abstract -
   
   Nowadays, many companies are using a stop and wait attendance system to mark the attendance of the employees in a company which 
   includes either an app to mark the attendance when the employee comes in the office premise or their is a system which scans the face 
   of the employee for which employee needs to wait and mark the attendance. Sometimes, if a bunch of employees come at a time, then 
   these employees need to wait to mark their attendance which takes a minimum of 5 to 10 minutes. When it comes to a company's point of 
   view, then these 5 to 10 minutes or more of each employee can be a trot to the company. What if these 5 to 10 minutes of each employee 
   in the worst case can be saved. So to address the above problem, the software named as Employee Monitoring System can be game changing 
   for companies which provides the real time employee monitoring feature reducing 5 to 10 minutes of employees time. The employee need 
   not have to wait to mark the attendance. As the employee is moving towards the entrance gate, the software through the camera will 
   automatically catch the employee's face and the attendance will be marked for that day.

2. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT

2.1 Softwares and Technologies Used:

2.1.1 Python: 
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Python has become a powerful tool for developing and evaluating computer vision models and algorithms. Its rich ecosystem of libraries offers a plethora of resources for image processing, object detection, and deep learning such as: OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch.

2.1.2 PyQt:  
Qt Designer is a Qt tool that provides you with a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) user interface to create GUIs for your PyQt applications productively and efficiently. With this tool, one can create attractive GUIs by dragging and dropping QWidget objects on an empty form. PyQt library is used to design the entire UI of the software.


2.1.3  OpenCV:
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision, image processing  and machine learning software library. Its rich ecosystem of libraries offers a plethora of resources for image processing, object detection, and deep learning such as: OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch. OpenCV is used as a primary library throughout the project.


2.1.4  Face Recognition Library:
Face Recognition Python library is built on top of dlib and provides a convenient interface for face recognition tasks. It provides a simple interface for face recognition tasks and utilises pre-trained models for face detection and recognition. Face Recognition Library is used for face detection and recognition in software.


2.1.5  SQLite:
SQLite is a database engine, in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database. Also it is software that allows users to interact with a relational database. Sqlite is used as a database to store the data of the users.


2.1.6  PyGSheets:
The pygsheets library is a Python library that provides a simple interface to integrate databases with Google Sheets using the Google Sheets API. It allows you to automate tasks such as reading and writing data to Google Sheets, formatting cells, creating charts, and more. As soon as a person's face is detected, the entire data of the person is shown on google sheets.
