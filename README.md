# Employee Monitoring System

Nowadays, many companies are using a stop and wait attendance system to mark the attendance of the employees in a company which includes either an app to mark the attendance when the employee comes in the office premise or their is a system which scans the face of the employee for which employee needs to wait. Sometimes, if a bunch of employees come at a time, then these employees need to wait to mark their attendance which takes a minimum of 5 to 10 minutes. When it comes to a company's point of view, these 5 to 10 minutes or more of each employee can be a trot to the company. What if these 5 to 10 minutes of each employee in the worst case can be saved. So to address the above problem, our software can be game changing for companies which provides the real time employee monitoring feature reducing 5 to 10 minutes of employees time. The employee need not have to wait to mark the attendance. As the employee is moving towards the entrance gate, the software through the camera will automatically catch the employee's face and the attendance will be marked for that day.
